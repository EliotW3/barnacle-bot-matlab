# barnacle-bot-matlab
An image processing module for MATLAB for identifying and measuring crowded images of barnacles.

## TODO
- Find morph operations to get barnacle image to a suitable spot
- Identify "holes" in barnacles and update accordingly to make size/area data accurate
- Produce data for diameter
- Conversion via input for meters to pixels, update all output data accordingly
- Easy to use interface, display charts and allow tweaking of thresholds/min-max areas/etc.
- Update README with how-to and images
- Port to python opencv
